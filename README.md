# Augvuln

## Overview

This replication package contains the dataset and code for our paper Root Cause Detection by Capturing Changed
code with Relational Graph Neural Networks.

This work struggle to solve the presence of labeling errors and characterizing noise in the code lines,
and imbalanced knowledge distribution within the code.AugVuln that integrates code quality detection with Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNNs) to improve root cause detection by more effectively capturing code changes. Specifically, the AugVuln incorporates three key components: (1) the Vulnerability Confidence Extractor for detecting and cleaning erroneous labels; (2) the Code Generation Enhancer, which generates balanced synthetic test cases via Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE); and (3) the Path-Aware Vulnerability Detector, which employs Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNNs) to capture changes in code lines and integrates residual networks to learn detailed representations of code execution paths.Through the synergistic operation of these three components, AugVuln effectively handles code lines with noisy labels and imbalanced knowledge distribution, leading to significant improvements in vulnerability detection
